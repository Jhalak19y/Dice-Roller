# Dice-Roller
This is a simple Python-based dice roller application that simulates rolling a six-sided dice. When the user decides to roll the dice, the program generates a random number between 1 and 6 and displays an ASCII art representation of the dice face corresponding to the rolled value.

Features:
1. Random Dice Roll: Generates a random number between 1 and 6 using the random module.
2. ASCII Art Display: Shows an ASCII art image of the dice face for the rolled number.
3. Interactive: Asks the user if they want to roll the dice and repeats based on user input.

Usage:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter 'y' to roll the dice.
3. View the rolled value and its corresponding ASCII art.
4. Decide whether to roll the dice again or end the game.
